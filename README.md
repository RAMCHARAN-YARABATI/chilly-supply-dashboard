# 🌶️ Chilly Farmers Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This Power BI project helps analyze which farmers consistently trust my uncle by delivering their chilly crops to him for sale. The goal is to identify:

- Who are the most loyal or trusted farmers  
- Who contributes the most crop over time  
- Patterns in crop delivery across days  

This is a real-world dataset collected manually to explore trust-based supply relationships in local agriculture.

## 📂 Data Source

The dataset is maintained in an Excel file and includes:
- 👨‍🌾 Farmer Names  
- 📅 Date of Delivery  
- 🧺 Quantity of Chillies (in kg)  

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- Total quantity supplied by each farmer  
- Daily and weekly trends in crop delivery  
- Comparison of farmer contributions  
- Time-based breakdowns (e.g., weekday vs. weekend)  

---

## 🧠 Key Observations

- On weekends, more farmers tend to harvest and deliver their crops.  
- Due to increased supply on weekends, the market price drops.  
- Weekday deliveries tend to fetch slightly better prices because supply is lower.  

These trends help understand not only farmer behavior but also supply-demand patterns over the week.
